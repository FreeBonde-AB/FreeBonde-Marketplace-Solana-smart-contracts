## Important Notes for Visitors

- **Network:**  
  This project is configured for Solana Devnet by default. Please do not use real assets or mainnet wallets for testing.

- **Wallet Support:**  
  The dApp currently supports Phantom Wallet. Make sure you have it installed and connected before interacting with the app.

- **NFT Minting:**  
  When minting an NFT, the NFT name follows a specific format for parsing plant and user data. Please do not modify the minting logic unless you understand the naming convention.

- **Marketplace Transactions:**  
  NFT sales require both the buyer and the seller to sign the transaction. The seller must be online and connected with their wallet to approve the sale.

- **No Multi-Wallet Support:**  
  The dApp does not support simultaneous multi-wallet signatures. Only the currently connected wallet can sign transactions.

- **Testing:**  
  All features should be tested on Devnet. If you encounter errors related to wallet signatures or transaction failures, ensure you are using the correct wallet and network.

- **Security:**  
  Do not use this project with valuable assets. This is a test/demo project and has not been audited.
