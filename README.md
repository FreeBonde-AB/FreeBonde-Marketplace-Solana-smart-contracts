## Project Overview

FreeBonde Marketplace is a decentralized marketplace built on the Solana blockchain, designed to facilitate the secure and efficient exchange of digital and physical assets. This project is being developed as a submission for the Solana hackathon.

## Key Features

*   **Decentralized Governance:** The marketplace utilizes a token-based governance system where FreeBonde token holders can participate in decisions and proposals related to the platform.
*   **Tokenized Ecosystem:** The platform is powered by the FreeBonde token, used for governance, rewards, and potentially other utilities within the marketplace.
* **NFT**: The marketplace uses NFTs to represent the different assets.
*   **Emergency Management:** A crisis management system allows the platform to adapt to unexpected situations and maintain stability.
*   **Voting and Proposals:** Token holders can create and vote on proposals, shaping the future of the platform.
* **Petitions**: Users can create petitions to suggest changes to the platform.
*   **Secure Transactions:** Built on Solana, the marketplace benefits from fast and low-cost transactions.
* **Modular code**: The program is made using different modules.
*   **Community-Driven:** The platform is designed to be community-driven, empowering users to participate in its development and operation.

## Project Structure

This repository contains the following key components:

*   **`src/lib.rs`:** The main entry point of the Solana program, defining the overall structure and modules.
*   **`src/freebonde_tokens.rs`:** The implementation of the FreeBonde token contract, including token creation, transfer, and governance features.
* `src/governance_contracts.rs`: The implementation of the governance contract.
* `src/nft_contracts.rs`: The implementation of the NFT contract.
*   **`tests/freebonde_tokens_tests.rs`:** A comprehensive test suite for the FreeBonde token contract.

## Current Progress

*   **FreeBonde Token Contract:** The core functionality of the FreeBonde token contract is complete, including token initialization, transfers, and governance-related actions.
* **Comprehensive Tests**: All the core functions of `freebonde_tokens.rs` have been tested.
* **Modular**: The program uses a modular approach.
* **Github**: The repository is in github, so you can track the progress.

## Next Steps

The following features are planned for implementation in the near future:

*   **NFT Contract Development:** Create the core NFT contract to represent assets on the marketplace.
*   **Marketplace Contract:** Build the core marketplace contract for asset listings and sales.
*   **Governance Contract**: Build the core governance contract.
* **More Tests**: Add more tests to the other contracts.
*   **UI Integration:** Design and implement a user-friendly interface for interacting with the marketplace.
